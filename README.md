# IH-savemydate-project2

This project was deployed in Heroku: https://save-my-date.herokuapp.com/

## Brief Description

This was a project developed in Ironhack Lisbon's web development Bootcamp. It was built by a team of three students: Guilherme Carmona, Natasha Silva e Carla Mendes.

It was built in order to incorporate the learning of module 2 of the curriculum, using the following technologies and tools:
- Node.Js;
- MongoDB;
- Express.Js;
- Bootstrap -> We had a limitation of 200 lines of CSS;
- Zomato Gold API -> Which was used to find establishments in the city of our choosing, but in end was also a limitation since it only shows whichever is registered in their database;

This project was made with love, team work and friendship and we are incredibly proud of it.

```sh
$ npm run dev
```
